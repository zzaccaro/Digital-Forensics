        <h3>Welcome to our 2016 Senior Project Page</h3>
          <p>For our project we created a virtual, interactive crime scene that uses the CAVE for the
            CS Elective Digital Forensics course at Villanova University.</p>
          <p>Check out our video here: </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Digital Forensics is one of the most popular CS electives.</li>
          <li>Students are taught how to retrieve digital evidence and are offered a trip to an FBI laboratory.</li>
          <li>Our team wished to simulate a crime scene which students could visit as well.</li>
          <li>Our goal is to supply students with an interactive environment in which they may practically apply what they have learned.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Meeting with Dr. Klassner and Prof. Price allowed us to plan our resources and vision.</li>
          <li>Dr. Klassner suggested the use of Vizard to design our digital environment and TurboSquid to buy digital models of “evidence” to be hidden.</li>
          <li>Accordingly, Dr. Price provided our team with a list of evidence that he would like to see included in the crime scenes.</li>
          <li>Our crime scenes would be explored by student groups of four or five at a time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Digital models were acquired from the TurboSquid and CGTrader websites.</li>
          <li>The apartment environment was provided, as it is the default environment used to demonstrate Villanova’s CAVE.</li>
          <li>Once the models were bought, the apartment was populated using the models as articles of “evidence.”</li>
          <li>Textures were added and manipulated to differentiate models from each other.</li>
          <li>Three different crime scenes were constructed, one of which is randomly selected for a given team to explore.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Results</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>The apartment environment can be explored using the CAVE.</li>
          <li>Our team was pleased to find that our drawer animations blended seamlessly within the CAVE environment.</li>
          <li>We achieved general interaction capabilities with most of the objects within the apartment environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Our team hopes that what we have created will be a valuable, interactive teaching resource for Digital Forensics courses in the future.</li>
          <li>We also hope that the demonstration of our crime scene environment will encourage other students to work with Villanova’s CAVE and build their own projects using it as a resource in the future.</li>
        </ul>
